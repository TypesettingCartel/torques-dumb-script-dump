# Everything about this is bad

All of this stuff is probably done better by other things.

###### Shift subs

Takes the difference between the start times of the first two selected
lines and then shifts all the lines in the selection by that difference.
The first selected line is deleted, under the assumption that it is
either a duplicate or otherwise worthless.

Useful when hotkeyed.
